    <h1>Apple Pie</h1>

        <img src="../img/applie-pie.jpg" alt="Beautiful looking apple pie.">

        <h3>The world's best apple pie!</h3>
        
        <p>This recipe is hands down, my favorite apple pie made from scratch! Juicy apple slices are coated in sugar and spices and then baked to perfection inside a flaky homemade pie crust.
        </p>
        <p>No need to worry about mushy apples or a soggy pie crust because this apple pie bakes to perfection every single time!</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>Pie Crust</li>

            <li>Apples</li>

            <li>Granulated Sugar</li>

            <li>Brown Sugar</li>

            <li>Flour</li>

            <li>Cinnamon</li>

            <li>Nutmeg</li>
            
            <li>Lemon</li>

            <li>Egg</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat oven to 425Â°F. Place 1 pie crust in ungreased 9-inch glass pie plate. Press firmly against side and bottom.</li>

            <li>In large bowl, gently mix filling ingredients; spoon into crust-lined pie plate. Top with second crust. Wrap excess top crust under bottom crust edge, pressing edges together to seal; flute. Cut slits or shapes in several places in top crust.</li>

            <li>Bake 40 to 45 minutes or until apples are tender and crust is golden brown. Cover edge of crust with 2- to 3-inch wide strips of foil after first 15 to 20 minutes of baking to prevent excessive browning. Cool on cooling rack at least 2 hours before serving.</li>

        </ol>
